How are we moving around our cities while facing a global pandemic? How have lockdowns affected movement? How do we accommodate urban travel that requires social distancing?

Using sensors from open data sources, we visualize movement of people on foot and by bicycle. Visualization reveals the role of weather, day of week, leisure, exercise, utility travel and compliance with lockdown measures. It helps to anticipate transport planning needs for a safe, sustainable urban travel future.

Explore the cities below.

- Pedestrian and bicycle travel in [Basel](docs/basel/).
- Pedestrian traffic in city centres across [Germany](docs/germany/) (and in [English](docs/germany/index_en)).
- Public bicycle hire use across [London](docs/london/).
- Bicycle traffic in [New York City](docs/newyork/).
- Pedestrian and bicycle travel in [Zurich](docs/zurich/) (and in [English](docs/zurich/zurich_en)).

#### We need your help
